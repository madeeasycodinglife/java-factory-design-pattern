**Java Factory Design Pattern: Creating Objects with a Factory**

The Factory Design Pattern is one of the creational design patterns in Java. It is used to create objects without
exposing the instantiation logic to the client and refers to the newly created object using a common interface.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simple example where we have different types of shapes (e.g., Circle and Rectangle)
that we want to create using a factory.

              Client
                |
           ShapeFactory
           /         \
      Circle       Rectangle
                   


```java
// Step 1: Define a common interface for shapes
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Step 2: Create concrete classes that implement the Shape interface
class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Rectangle");
    }
}

// Step 3: Create a ShapeFactory to create Shape objects
class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("Circle")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("Rectangle")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }
        return null; // Return null for unsupported shape types
    }
}

// Step 4: Client code that uses the factory to create objects
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();

        // Create Circle
        Shape circle = factory.createShape("Circle");
        circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Circle

        // Create Rectangle
        Shape rectangle = factory.createShape("Rectangle");
        rectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a Rectangle
    }
}
```

**How to Identify When to Apply the Factory Design Pattern:**

1. **Multiple Implementations:** If you have a common interface or base class and multiple implementations of that interface,
 the Factory Pattern can help create instances of these implementations without exposing their details.

2. **Complex Object Creation:** When object creation involves complex logic or conditions, using a factory method simplifies
 the client code and centralizes the creation logic.

3. **Reducing Coupling:** If you want to reduce tight coupling between the client code and the concrete classes it creates,
the Factory Pattern allows you to create objects using an abstract interface or base class.

4. **Conditional Object Creation:** When you need to create objects based on certain conditions or configurations,
the Factory Pattern provides a clean way to encapsulate this logic.

**Where to Apply the Factory Design Pattern:**

- **Framework Libraries:** Frameworks often use the Factory Pattern to create objects, allowing you to customize their
 behavior by extending or implementing factory classes or methods.

- **Dependency Injection:** Dependency injection frameworks, such as Spring, use factory patterns to create and manage
objects in a configurable way.

- **Plugin Systems:** When building systems that support plugins or extensions, factories can dynamically load and create
different plugin instances based on configurations.

- **Test Automation:** In test automation, factories can be used to create test objects with different configurations and data.

- **Database Access:** Factory patterns are used in database access layers to create database connections or data access objects.

- **GUI Components:** In graphical user interface development, factories can create different UI components based on user input
or configuration.

By applying the Factory Design Pattern in the right situations, you can improve code organization, maintainability, and
flexibility in your Java applications.
